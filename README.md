ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: 

â€˜Tis but thy name that is my enemy;
Thou art thyself, though not a Montague.
Whatâ€™s Montague? It is nor hand, nor foot,
Nor arm, nor face, nor any other part
Belonging to a man. O, be some other name!
Whatâ€™s in a name? That which we call a rose
By any other name would smell as sweet;
So Romeo would, were he not Romeo callâ€™d,
Retain that dear perfection which he owes
Without that title. Romeo, doff thy name,
And for that name which is no part of thee
Take all myself.

âš¡ Fun fact: I live in a hut in a forest.
